## ACM Additions and Changes Notes (2016-03-30)

The connection of Officers and their membership to the Executive Council is not very clear in chapter 1 and 2.

All references of the officers addressed as "required" or "core" should now be referred as "required officers."

Any reference to our student chapter should be referenced as "the Chapter." (Because it is used as a proper noun, Chapter should always be capitalized)

Bylaw IX subsec. 2: move elections to last meeting of February.

Page 13: Add a disclaimer that links to the SILC info on how no dues are allowed at KU. We encourage people join ACM, but we cannot require money of them.

Page 10: Change the word "groom" to "vet."

Chapter 6: Change wording in lines of "All purchases over \$50 must be approved by....."

__Chapter 3: Bylaws__ has been approved (with changes noted above) by the Executive Council.
