\label{chap:intro}

\initial{W}elcome to the first edition of the KU ACM Student Chapter Officer's Handbook. This will be your guide on how to best run the ACM Student Chapter and ensure its success for now and the years ahead. This handbook is to be passed down to each new group of officers and can be edited and revised as seen fit. However, this should not apply to official parent organization guidelines, governance, and bylaws. Currently, this chapter has a short history, but it is built of very proud and passionate individuals. Hopefully, these tidbits on the lessons and rules we learned will help you avoid and learn from our mistakes.
